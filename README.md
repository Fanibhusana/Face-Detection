# Face Detection using OpenCV in Java

![Project Image](images/project_image.jpg)

This project demonstrates a basic face detection application using OpenCV in Java. It loads an image, detects faces, draws rectangles around them, and saves the resulting image with the detected faces highlighted.

## Features

- Load an image for face detection.
- Utilize a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for face detection.
- Draw green rectangles around detected faces in the image.
- Save the modified image with the detected faces highlighted.
